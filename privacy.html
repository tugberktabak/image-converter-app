    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Image Converter</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) handles user data.
      Your privacy is extremely important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Image and File Processing</h2>
    <p>
      All image-related operations performed in Image Converter (including image conversion, image resizing,
      and image compression) are processed <strong>entirely on your device</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Your images and files are never uploaded to our servers.</strong>  
      We do not collect, store, analyze, or share your photos, files, or their contents in any way.
      Images remain on your device at all times unless you explicitly choose to share or export them.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Google Firebase Analytics</strong> solely to understand how the app is used and to improve
      performance, stability, and user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firebase Analytics may collect anonymized and aggregated information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>App usage statistics (e.g., feature usage, screen views)</li>
      <li>Device and app information (e.g., device model, operating system version, app version)</li>
      <li>General usage patterns and performance metrics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data does <strong>not</strong> include your images or their content.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Identification (Supabase)</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Supabase</strong> only for basic user identification purposes, such as assigning and managing
      a user ID.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supabase is <strong>not</strong> used to store personal content, images, or sensitive personal information.
      The user ID is used strictly for technical and functional purposes within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Image Converter uses <strong>RevenueCat</strong> as its payment and subscription management infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      All payment-related information is handled directly by the App Store and RevenueCat.
      We do <strong>not</strong> access, store, or process your credit card details or billing information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect personal data such as your name, email address, photos, or files.
      Any data processed by third-party services is used only for the purposes described above and
      remains outside our direct control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your personal information is <strong>never sold, shared, or transferred</strong> by us to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since images and files never leave your device, the risk of unauthorized access to your content is minimized.
      We rely on trusted third-party providers for analytics, user identification, and payments, each of which
      applies its own industry-standard security measures.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements.
      Any updates will be published within the app or on the relevant distribution platform.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
